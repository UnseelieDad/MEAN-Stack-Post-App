# MEAN Stack Posting app
 This is a quick project to practice and refresh myself on the MEAN stack.
 Features include the ability to create an account, log-in and make posts. These posts include a title, picture uploaded fromm the user, and content. Users can edit and delete their posts after making them, but they cannot delete posts of other users. 
 User login and authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens that are stored in Angular's local storage and last  for an hour before expriing and logging the user out.
 This application  also includes pagination to allow the user to define how many posts they'd like to see at once.
 The design of the site was accommplished using Material UI.
