# MEAN Stack Posting app
 This is a quick project to practice and refresh myself on the MEAN stack.
 (Angular front end, NodeJS/Express Rest API, MongoDB Database)
 Features include: 
 - The ability to create an account, log-in and make posts 
 - Posts include a title, picture uploaded fromm the user, and content. 
 - Users can edit and delete their posts after making them, but they cannot delete posts of other users. 
 - User login and authentication handled using JSON Web Tokens that are stored in Angular's local storage. 
 - Tokens last for an hour before expriing and logging the user out.
 - Pagination is used to allow the user to define how many posts they'd like to see at once.
 - The design of the site was accommplished using Material UI.
